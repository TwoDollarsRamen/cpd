 == Feedback & Playtesting ==

This file contains the outcome of the presentation and playtesting
session that I ran.

At first, the game didn't run at all, due to a strange bug where the
player was not appearing in the build. The problem was that the player
was spawning in and falling down before everything else had loaded.
I patched this by simply adding a main menu that loads before the main
scene.

After that, playtesting went fine. There was a bug where sometimes the
space bar wouldn't get registered. It was solved by running the code to
check the state of the space bar in the "Update" function instead of the
"FixedUpdate" function.

The feedback from my presentation was that everything worked perfectly
once the previously explained bugs had been fixed.
