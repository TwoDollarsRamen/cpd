# Flappy Sphere
Cross Platform Development project

## Building & Running
Open project in Unity and open the "menu" scene. Since this project is designed to
run in a portrait view, setting the correct resolution in the editor is required.
Click on the "Game" view tab, and open the resolutions dialogue (next to the display
dialogue, on the left at the top of the "Game" view). Click the small "+" symbol at
the bottom of this dialogue, and add a new resolution with a width of 260 and a
height of 560. This resolution will mean the game will look and behave correctly.
Once this is done, the "play" button may be clicked.

## How to play
The goal is the get the sphere between the pipes. To do this, the jump button
(space bar on Windows and web and the green button at the bottom of the screen
with a white arrow on it on mobile and in the editor) may be pressed.
